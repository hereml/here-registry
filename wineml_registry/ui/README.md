# WineML UI

This UI serves to have a visualized frontend for Data Science teams to keep track of what models they have and have a clear view of what is the latest version and status of their models.

# Status

Currently it is only viewable and does not have any interactions to the model itself, there will be plans to integrate some actions such as tagging models, updating model status etc.
